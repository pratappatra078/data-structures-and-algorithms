/*
Given the number of questions as n, and marks for the correct answer as p and q marks for the incorrect answer. One can either attempt to solve the question in an examination and get either p marks if the answer is right, or q marks if the answer is wrong, or leave the question unattended and get 0 marks. The task is to find the count of all the different possible marks that one can score in the examination.
Input 1: n = 2, p = 1, q = -1
Output 1: 5
Explanation: The different possible marks are: -2, -1, 0, 1, 2
