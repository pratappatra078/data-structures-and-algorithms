# 🧠 DSA Problem-Solving Patterns & Notes

This file contains **core patterns** used to solve most DSA problems.
If a problem feels hard, it usually belongs to one of these patterns.

## Sorting 
### selection sort
- selection sort -> select small element from rest of the array and swap
- Time complexity: O(n^2)
- Space complexity: O(1)

### bubble sort
- bubble sort -> check adjacent elements if wrong order then swap
- Time Complexity : worst case(n^2) best case(n)
- Space Complexity : O(1)
- bubble sort -> move big element to end 

### Insertion Sort
- selection sort -> take element and place in correct position by swaping 
- Time Complexity : Best case -> O(n)
                  average and worst case -> O(n^2)
- space Complexity: O(1)
